      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">How it all started</h1>
      
      <p className="mb-4">This week I spent most of my time writing about something very close to my heart. It's my journey from a tier 3 private non-tech degree to earning *enough* as an above-average writer and marketer living in Bangalore.</p>

      
      <p className="mb-4">It all started when I enrolled at my university - not knowing how bad it was going to be. I enrolled without filling out any forms, knowing that "Anyway, I need to do something of my own, and a degree doesn't really matter"</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">(Yes, I didn't get into any of the top universities in India :D).</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Anyway, I attended my first class (online of course) and immediately realised that this place wasn't going to take me anywhere. The professors had all studied there and the students were mostly millionaire kids with zero ambition.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">I knew I had to do something, so I spent the next month,</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">I knocking, DMing, texting and emailing everyone I could, looking for work opportunities. Free, paid or paid in exposure? Doesn't matter - I wanted something on my resume to really get me started.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">I got two gigs and worked at each one for a couple of months, and that's where it all started. I actually had something to show someone.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">But that's all it was - a means to an end. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">(Contrary to popular belief, working for free or for less isn't nearly as beneficial as working for money. Think about it from your employer's point of view.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">There's a business rule that says you need to generate 6x of your salary to be considered a valuable resource.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">6x of 0 is... well, 0.)</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Then I used this resume and repeated - knocking, texting, DMing, emailing - just about everything you can do.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Which eventually led me to a place called - OWLED, also from an Instagram DM. Weird, right?</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">And that is where I learnt pretty much everything, basically, everything I do now started here. And it was for 5000 rupees a month.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">It might sound small, but for me, at the age of 19, it was a big deal. Because of my work there, more and more opportunities came my way.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">At OWLED, the company was less than 10 people when I joined and grew 5 times by the time I left. In those 18 months, I learnt how to write online, why brands want distribution, how marketing works, what it's like to think about new initiatives, how to manage a team, how to work with external stakeholders and way too many things I didn't know at all.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">So I definitely learned skills that are still paying dividends today.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">From there I went on to get my own clients like Dezerv, Vidyo, Solana and many more!</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">What I want to tell you about this whole thing is the concept of Inertia.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Yes, that inertia you read about in physics.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">Inertia is a passive property and does not allow a body to do anything other than resist active agents such as forces and torques.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">So it is just that when you are not moving it is hard to start moving and the same goes for when you are moving it is hard to stop moving.</p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">All you need is that first kick and I hope you do everything you can to make it happen - ask your elders, your siblings, your parents, strangers on the internet, share your work and just do anything to get started!</p>
